        <ul>
            <li>Click download to download the files</li>
            <li>Move both the files into the same folder, they are both required to be in the same folder to run correctly</li>
            <li>Run the file "impostor.exe"</li>
            <li>Some people may be given a windows defender smart screen, this is only because I am not a large corporation, to bypass this, click "more info" and then click "run anyway"</li>
